Polygon Project 3:

ZK SNARK Designer

Overview
This project implements a logical gate using the Circom programming language. The goal is to prove knowledge of inputs A (0) and B (1) that yield a 0 output. We achieve this by creating a circuit, compiling it, generating a proof, deploying a Solidity verifier contract to Sepolia, and verifying the proof.

## Quick Start
Compile the LogicCircuit() circuit and verify it against a smart contract verifier

## Circom Logic Gate code:
```circuits
           â””â”€â”€LogicCircuit
                          â””â”€â”€circuit.circom
```

### Install
`npm i`

### Compile
`npx hardhat circom` 
This will generate the **out** file with circuit intermediaries and geneate the **LogicCircuitVerifier.sol** contract

### Prove and Deploy on sepolia test network
`npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.ts --network sepolia`
This script does 4 things  
1. Deploys the LogicCircuitVerifier.sol contract
2. Generates a proof from circuit intermediaries with `generateProof()`
3. Generates calldata with `generateCallData()`
4. Calls `verifyProof()` on the verifier contract with calldata.

With two commands you can compile a ZKP, generate a proof, deploy a verifier, and verify the proof ðŸŽ‰


**contracts**
```
contracts
â””â”€â”€ LogicCircuitVerifier.sol
```
Verifier contracts are autogenerated and prefixed by the circuit name, in this example **LogicCircuit**

## hardhat.config.ts
```
  circom: {
    // (optional) Base path for input files, defaults to `./circuits/`
    inputBasePath: "./circuits",
    // (required) The final ptau file, relative to inputBasePath, from a Phase 1 ceremony
    ptau: "powersOfTau28_hez_final_12.ptau",
    // (required) Each object in this array refers to a separate circuit
    circuits: JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(circuits))
  },
```
## Verify Proof:

Call the verifyProof() method on the verifier contract and assert the output is true.
